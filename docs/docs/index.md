# Project Introduction

In collaboration with the University of Queensland’s (UQ) Co-Innovation Research group, my capstone research topic will be on the application of big data analytics to support an ongoing research towards conceptualization and implementation of smart city technology in UQ, which aims toward reducing the adverse impact of campus culture shock. With access to the monumental amount of data provided by UQ’s Information Technology Services Division, the development team can benefit immensely from an analytic solution that could provide insights to further develop technologies that can be deployed across UQ campus.


## Objectives

* Explore data visualization for developers and researchers to better interact with the data
*	Analyze the geo-spatial data or campus residents to provide insights of their interaction with UQ system in and out of campus
*	Perform data integration that may show relationship between campus activities engagement and resource use
